(Student: Shanni, Xinyu) still discussed the data structure and all function we may need and may need to be implemented
(Admin: Rebecca, Juno) Began coding the fragment UIs, and created the Course object with a blank constructor, a filled constructor (code, name, bool[] of offering sessions, List<Course> of prerequisites), and a static list of Course objects to represent the course list.
(Login: Ruofan) I was sick and missed the group tutorial meeting; but I catched up with the discussed information after.
